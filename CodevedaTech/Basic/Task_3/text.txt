Whispers of the Dawn

When morning breaks through silent skies,
And golden light begins to rise,
The world awakes in softest hue,
A gentle promise, fresh and new.

The dewdrops shine on blades of green,
Like tiny stars in daylight seen.
The breeze, a song without a name,
Still stirs the heart all just the same.

So walk with hope and steady pace,
Let kindness shine upon your face.
For every day, a canvas wideâ€”
Paint it with love, and not with pride
